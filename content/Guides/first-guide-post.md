Summary: How I made this blog, another example of my constant project hopping. Will I finish it? Probably not, but let's see what happens

This blog is going to be yet another example of my never ending desire to become worryingly obsessed with a new project for a few days/weeks/months. The end goal is to have this website finished and functional with a domain name and hosted on the web. I also need to make sure I have a SSL certificate so I can have https on the site. I have chosen linode as the provider for this project, because with them I can get a full blown linux cloud server to myself! Then I will have the extra little challenge of setting up a webserver. Not sure if I am going to go with apache or nginx.
