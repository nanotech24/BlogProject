The end goal is to have this website finished and functional with a domain name and hosted on the web. I also need to make sure I have a SSL certificate so I can have https on the site. I have chosen linode as the provider for this project, because with them I can get a full blown linux cloud server to myself! Then I will have the extra little challenge of setting up a webserver. Not sure if I am going to go with apache or nginx.",
