 
Metadata syntax for Markdown posts should follow this pattern:

Title: My super title
Date: 2010-12-03 10:20
Modified: 2010-12-05 19:30
Category: Python
Tags: pelican, publishing
Slug: my-super-post
Authors: Alexis Metaireau, Conan Doyle
Summary: Short version for index and feeds

This is the content of my super blog post.
You can also have your own metadata keys (so long as they don’t conflict with reserved metadata keywords) for use in your templates. The following table contains a list of reserved metadata keywords:

Metadata	Description
title	Title of the article or page
date	Publication date (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD HH:SS)
modified	Modification date (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD HH:SS)
tags	Content tags, separated by commas
keywords	Content keywords, separated by commas (HTML content only)
category	Content category (one only — not multiple)
slug	Identifier used in URLs and translations
author	Content author, when there is only one
authors	Content authors, when there are multiple
summary	Brief description of content for index pages
lang	Content language ID (en, fr, etc.)
translation	If content is a translation of another (true or false)
status	Content status: draft, hidden, or published
